94,Space Invaders Game,Game Development,"It's the archade favorite built using the turtle library with turtle objects for invaders, bunkers, a defender, a mothership, and friggin' lasers! There is logic to define the properties of shooting and detection for if an object is hit. The scoreboard keeps tracks of game status, points and lives. The bunker blocks disappear when hit, and there is even a mothership turtle that periodically comes by to wreck havoc. The game continues until all invaders are destroyed, the defender loses all available lives, or an invader collides with the defender. This project relied heavily on namespaces and class structure. Pew pew!"
92,Craft Beer Web Scraper,Web Scraping,"This project uses the Beautiful Soup library to scrape html text and build a pandas dataframe of the results. It is specifically written to work on the Target website to scrape all of their craft beer for sale. To retreive the most information available, the driver first scrapes the list of all 24 product links on the first search results page before repeating the process for other results pages. Then the driver loops through the list of product lists to scrape individual product pages for each beer. Shoutout to London App Brewery for designing this course."
89,Disappearing Writing App,Desktop App,"Want to finish some writing but are not feeling the motivation? Need a commitment device to force yourself to work? Well, here is a notepad that that lets you write for a defined amout if time but will delete all of your work if you stop for two minutes. It's as cruel as it is effective. The GUI was built using tkinter and features responsive buttons with the ability to customize the session time. All work is automatically saved to the downloads folder as a txt file at the end fo the session."
86,Breakout Game,Game Development,"The classic Atari game Breakout was developed by Steve Wozniak in 1976 as a response to Pong (see Day 22 in the GitHub link for that one). This adaptation of breakout includes the standard elements of a bouncing ball directed by a paddle to break through layers of blocks. A scoreboard keeps track of points and the score. The game ends when all lives are lost or all blocks are broken; however, the difficulty increases at specific milestones in play. The most unique element of the game was capturing the ball moverment. Getting the bounce angle right from walls and blocks was relatively easy by storing the angle, orientation, and speed in a ball class object. Bouncing off the paddle was especially challenging, since I found the game was not fun if each bounce was 90 degrees. Now the angle of the bouce changes based where on the paddle the ball hits (with the extreme ends giving the most extreme changes in direction). "
53,Zilow Data Entry Job Automation,Web Scraping,"Why quit your dull, data-entry job when you can automate it?! This project uses the Selenium web driver and Beautiful Soup to navigate through Zillow, parse the html text, and extract the data to be saved to a pandas dataframe. The use case here searches for prices, addresses, and links to rental units being advertised on Zillow."
51,Internet Speed Twitter Complaint Bot,Automation,"What else is Twitter for besides shouting into the void? Well, now it's easier than ever! This program uses the selenium library to automatically run an internet speed test in a Chrome browser. Then it scrapes that data, logs into Twitter, and tweets out how slow the speed is. I opted to not tag my own internet service provider becuase I don't like confrentation."
46,Musical Time Machine,Web Scraping,"Time travel is easier than you think. This project uses Beautiful Soup to scrape the Billboard Top 100 songs from a user-defined date. Then it accesses the Spotify API to search for each song and adds them to a personal playlist. The example shown is from when I graduated from undergrad, and it brings me right back to the campus of John Carroll University in 2011. Follow the GitHub link to see the full list. Reach out to me if you want a playlist from a specific date too!"
39-40,Cheap Flight Finder,Automation,"Welcome to the frugal flyers program! This project begins with a list of cities, airport codes, and reservation prices (in GBP) for how much a person is willing to pay to travel from London to a given city. The information is read from a Google Sheet (for easy, user-friendly editing as budgets and travel ambitions change) and then matched against the Tequila API to retrieve the lowest-cost flight for a given destinaiton. After checking all cities on the list, an SMS text is sent using the Twilio API with a price drop alert and link to purchase the discount flight."
36,Stock Activity Monitor,Automation,"This project has three components. First, the program uses the Alpha Vantage API to check for daily changes in the the stock price for AMZ (Amazon). Second, the program is connected to the News API and can retreive articles from a given keyword search. Finally, there is an alert mechanism that checks whether Amazon stock has changed by 5%, and if so, will use the Twilio API to send an SMS text message with the percent change in the stock price along with three news stories that mention the keyword."
31,Flash Card App,Desktop App,"Learn French (or whatever you want) with a desktop flashcard app. It is built for this individual use case but can easily be customized to a new domain with a few header changes and a new CSV of prompts and answers. This app also saves progress at the end of the session by saving which terms were marked as ""known"". Add new items by simply adding to the included CSV. The GUI built with tkinter and a little help from pandas."
18,Turtle Drawings,Desktop App,"Extract colors from a picture using the colorgram library and then use the turtle library to create a work of art in the style of Damien Hirst or Jackson Pollock. The examples shown use a still from the movie Kill Bill vol. 1; however, you can use any png or jpg file. Art begets art. See the GitHub link above to also explore a series of drawing challenges associated with the Day 18."
