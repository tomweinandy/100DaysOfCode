HOUSE RULES
* The deck is unlimited in size with no jokers.
* There is no betting, splitting, doubling down, or foul language.
* The Ace automatically counts as 11, until a hand is over 21, when it becomes a 1.
* The game ends if a player is dealt a blackjack (Ace and a 10/Jack/Queen/King).
* The computer is the dealer--it must take a card until it is 17 or over (unless you bust).
